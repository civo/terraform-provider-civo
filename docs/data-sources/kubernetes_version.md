### Nested Schema for `filter`

Required:

- **key** (String) Filter versions by this key. This may be one of `default`, `label`, `type`, `version`.
- **values** (List of String) Only retrieves `versions` which keys has value that matches one of the values provided here

Optional:

- **all** (Boolean) Set to `true` to require that a field match all of the `values` instead of just one or more of them. This is useful when matching against multi-valued fields such as lists or sets where you want to ensure that all of the `values` are present in the list or set.
- **match_by** (String) One of `exact` (default), `re`, or `substring`. For string-typed fields, specify `re` to match by using the `values` as regular expressions, or specify `substring` to match by treating the `values` as substrings to find within the string field.
