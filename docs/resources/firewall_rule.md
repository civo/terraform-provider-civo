# civo_firewall_rule (Resource)

Provides a Civo Firewall Rule resource. This can be used to create, modify, and delete firewalls rules. This resource don't have an update option because the backend don't have the support for that, so in this case we use ForceNew for all object in the resource.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Query small instance size
data "civo_instances_size" "small" {
    filter {
        key = "name"
        values = ["g3.small"]
        match_by = "re"
    }

    filter {
        key = "type"
        values = ["instance"]
    }

}

# Query instance template
data "civo_template" "debian" {
   filter {
        key = "name"
        values = ["debian-10"]
   }
}

# Create a new instance
resource "civo_instance" "foo" {
    hostname = "foo.com"
    size = element(data.civo_instances_size.small.sizes, 0).name
    template = element(data.civo_template.debian.templates, 0).id
}

# Create a network
resource "civo_network" "custom_net" {
    label = "my-custom-network"
}

# Create a firewall
resource "civo_firewall" "custom_firewall" {
  name = "my-custom-firewall"
  network_id = civo_network.custom_net.id
}

# Create a firewall rule and only allow
# connections from instance we created above
resource "civo_firewall_rule" "custom_port" {
    firewall_id = civo_firewall.custom_firewall.id
    protocol = "tcp"
    start_port = "3000"
    end_port = "3000"
    cidr = [format("%s/%s",civo_instance.foo.public_ip,"32")]
    direction = "ingress"
    label = "custom-application"
    depends_on = [civo_firewall.custom_firewall]
}
```
