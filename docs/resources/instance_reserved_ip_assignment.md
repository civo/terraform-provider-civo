# civo_instance_reserved_ip_assignment (Resource)

The instance reserved ip assignment resource schema definition. If you are using this resource to assign a reserved IP to an instance, instances `public_ip` attribute won't be updated until the next state refresh. If subsequent resources are relying instances public IP consider assigning the reserved ip address to the instance.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Send to create a reserved IP
resource "civo_reserved_ip" "www" {
    name = "nginx-www" 
}

# We assign the reserved IP to the instance
resource "civo_instance_reserved_ip_assignment" "webserver-www" {
  instance_id = civo_instance.www.id
  reserved_ip_id = civo_reserved_ip.web-server.id
}
```
